In order to run the code click run in Eclipse/IntelliJ, this will load up the initial menu frame.
From there enter your player names and click the 'Start' button to run the program.

When you're in the actual game you can enter e.g. 'move 1 7' (in the command input box) to move the checker on position 1 to position 7.
NOTE: We have also made it so that you can click the checker you want to move and then click the position you want to move it to - 
give it a try.

Click the 'Roll Dice' button to roll the dice. You can only roll once per turn.
We have also made it more interactive meaning you must click the 'Roll Dice' button yourself at the beginning of each go to roll the dice.
To move onto the next player enter 'next' in the command input window and click enter.
